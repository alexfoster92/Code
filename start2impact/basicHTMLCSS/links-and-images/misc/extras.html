    <!-- Used to link to pages that are in a directory above the current file -->
    <li>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may also be interested in <a

    <h2>Character Sets</h2>
    <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>bir</li>
        <li>iki</li>
        <li>üç</li>
        <li>dört</li>
        <li>beş</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- This is more relevant to straight HTML, as the UTF-8 character set should allow us to insert whatever we want into HTML without any problems -->
    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <!-- These need to be coded with & at the beginning and a ; at the end. e.g. "&amp;" displays as an "&" -->
    <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should always use HTML entities for these
        three characters.</p>
    <!-- These need to hug the text affected with no spaces -->
    <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes quite a
        bit.</p>
